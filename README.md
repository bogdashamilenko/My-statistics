Hey, here i explore the data with different statistical tests and then I interpret the results. 
Following the code with my notes after test you can easily see the insides of the data and see the quantitative differenceds between 
studied groups. For example income.analysis contatins my studies using Three-way ANOVA to determine the influence of three categorical
features on the income (continuous data) . Please feel free to explore data :)
